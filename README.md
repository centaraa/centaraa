- 👋 Hi, I’m @centaraa!
- 👀 I’m interested in bioimage analysis for 3D fluorescence data. My biological sample of choice are embryos!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything related to image analysis, mainly about segmentation, denoising, and tracking.
- 💞️ For now, I am not looking to collaborate on a specific research topic, but that might change!
